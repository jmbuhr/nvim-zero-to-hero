# Zero to Hero in Neovim

{{< qrcode https://github.com/jmbuhr/nvim-zero-to-hero >}}

## Structure

- first: general tips and tricks you can use in any vim
- second: configuring neovim and learning lua
- third: write a small "plugin" in lua to play a sound

## Installation

<https://github.com/neovim/neovim>

- Go to: <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable>
- download latest release for your system
  - On windows, I recommend WSL2 and then continue like on linux, then you have a nice terminal as well (otherwise its also fine to use the msi)
  - for linux, I recommend the appimage nvim.appimage
  - download it to somewhere on your path and make it executable, e.g.

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/stable/nvim.appimage -O /usr/bin/nvim && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/nvim
```

- execute with nvim
- if you are on ubuntu and the appimage doesn't start, run `sudo apt install libfuse2`
